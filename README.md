### PROJECT TITLE
Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves analyzing customer data for a subscription service to identify 
segments and trends and to understand customers' behavior, track subscription types, 
and identify key trends in cancellations and renewals Using Excel and SQL. An interactive dashboard in PowerBI is used to present the analysis.
### PROJECT OBJECTIVES
- to succinctly uncover key customer subscription indexes
- to track subscription types
- to distinguish between customers and their subscription types
- to create an interactive daashboard showcasing subscription key trends
### TOOLS USED
Microsoft Excel

### DATA SOURCE
The Primary Data used here is lita capstone project.xlsx for customer subscription data. This is gotten from an open source data site such as kaggle.
### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATIONS
At the preliminary stage of the data cleaning and preparations process, we performed the following actions
I.Data loading and inspection.

Data loading and inspection are crucial steps in data analysis, ensuring accuracy and reliability. In Excel, data is loaded through importing CSV or Excel files, while in SQL, data is queried from databases using SELECT statements. Once loaded, data inspection involves checking for missing values, outliers, and data types using Excel's Data Validation or SQL's summary statistics. Power BI enhances data inspection through interactive visualizations, allowing users to quickly identify trends and anomalies. Using Power BI's Data Profiling tool, distribution, quality, and relationships within the data can be examined.

ii. Handling missing variables

In Excel, missing values can be handled using tools like the Data Validation tool to replace blanks with specific text. Power BI provides features like "Fill" and "Replace Blank" to handle missing values, as well as the "Modeling" tab's "New Table" feature to create calculated tables that account for missing data.

iii. Data cleaning and formatting

In Excel, data cleaning involves removing duplicates (using "Remove Duplicates" tool), and formatting data (using Text to Columns, Trim, and PROPER functions). Power BI's Power Query Editor provides feature like  "Transform" to remove blanks, trim text, and change data types. Excel's "Data Validation" and Power BI's "Data Profiling" tools help identify inconsistencies and errors.
### EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
This involves exploring of the data to answer some questions such as;
- Which region recorded the highest sales revenue in customers' subscription
- What is the sum of sales Revenue
- What is the top selling subscription type
- Top 5 customers
- What is the sum of revenue by region
### DATA ANALYSIS
INSIGHTS

i. Incubator hub recorded $68M in total revenue for 2024 with the Eastern Region recording a total of $16,958,763M in sales which makes the Eastern region the highest in sales revenue.

ii. The top selling subscription type for customers is the Basic subscription type due to it's affordability.

iii. The top 2 performing regions are the East and South regions with a total of $34M in subscription sales.

iv. The top five customers are  Anna, Liam, Mike, Nina and Sophia
### DATA VISUALIZATION
These are some of the visuals from pivot tables, SQL and an interactive PowerBI dashboard to visualize a well detailed representation of my analysis.

### CONCLUSION
This analysis shows that customers prefer the Basic subscription package to other types due to its affordable rate. It further reveals that the Eastern and Southern regions have come to embrace our subscription packages regardless of the type.
### RECOMMENDATIONS
- create more awareness on the advantage of premium subscription package
- to make the premium package more attractive by introducing new perks while reducing cancellations.
- to employ field marketers in the north and west regions to create awareness on how to use different subscription packages to their advantage
- improve on the premium subscription type to attract more customers to subscribe üëå
